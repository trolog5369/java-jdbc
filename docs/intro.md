# JDBC — Introduction

## What is JDBC?

JDBC stands for **Java Database Connectivity**.  
It is a powerful API that allows Java programs to access and manipulate data stored in a wide variety of databases.

**API = Application Programming Interface**

## What is an API?

Example:

In marriages, there are a variety of food counters (**Front-end**)  
The food is being made in the kitchens (**Back-end**) in raw form

Waiters (**API**) carry food to the food counters in the appropriate form (cooked)

Same is with data.

Food Counters (Front-end) → Waiters (API) → Kitchen (Back-end)

An API acts as an interface between the client and the server.

- It handles requests and their corresponding responses
- Request is raised by the client
- Response is generated by the server

## JDBC as an API

JDBC is an API used to connect Java with a database.  
It helps Java communicate with databases.

Java (Programming Language) → JDBC (API) → Database (Entity)

## Definition of JDBC

JDBC is an API that defines how a client can connect to a database, send SQL queries and statements, and retrieve and manipulate the results.

---

## Components of JDBC

JDBC consists of:
- A set of interfaces and classes written in Java
- A JDBC Driver implemented by vendors to comply with JDBC
- A database server that supports JDBC

---

## Benefits of JDBC

- Independence
- Security
- Ease of use for Java developers who need to access databases

---

## JDBC Architecture

### Client
A JDBC client is any Java application that connects to a server-based database using JDBC APIs.

### Driver Manager
The DriverManager is a service of the JDBC API that:
- Manages JDBC drivers
- Establishes a connection between JDBC client and database server

### Database Server
A database server is a software program that provides management functionality within a networked computing environment.

Client → DriverManager → Database Server

## Why JDBC?

**Interoperability**
- Universal API for accessing and interacting with any SQL database

**Performance**
- JDBC allows applications to cache data more efficiently
- Facilitates retrieval of multiple rows in one database operation

**Flexibility**
- Provides flexibility in choosing vendor-specific or vendor-neutral databases

## Types of JDBC Drivers

### Type 1 — JDBC ODBC Bridge Driver
- Performance issues
- Uses ODBC driver to communicate with the database
- Not recommended for new applications

### Type 2 — Native API Driver
- Provides a JDBC interface to a specific database engine
- Translates JDBC calls into database engine native library calls

### Type 3 — Network Protocol Driver
- Uses client/server architecture with middleware (application server)
- Middleware provides communication between JDBC client and database server

### Type 4 — Thin Driver
- Pure Java driver
- Translates JDBC calls into network protocol calls
- Communicates directly with the database server
- Provides best performance and scalability
