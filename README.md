# Java JDBC — Foundation of Database Interaction in Java

## Overview

This repository represents the **completion of my hands-on learning phase of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**.

The goal was **not** to build flashy applications, but to deeply understand:
- how Java talks to a relational database
- how SQL execution actually works under the hood
- what higher-level frameworks abstract away

This repository now stands as a **closed foundation layer** in my backend engineering journey.

---

## Why This Repository Exists

Most developers jump straight into frameworks like Spring Boot and Hibernate without understanding what they are abstracting.

I deliberately built this repository to:
- work with **raw JDBC**
- understand database connections, queries, and result handling
- learn **failure cases**, not just success paths
- build confidence before moving to ORM and backend frameworks

This repo answers one question clearly:

> *“Do you actually understand database interaction in Java — or are you just using magic?”*

## Concepts Implemented

### JDBC Core
- JDBC architecture and drivers
- Establishing database connections using `DriverManager`
- Managing `Connection` lifecycle

### SQL Execution
- `Statement` vs `PreparedStatement`
- Parameterized queries
- Executing queries and updates
- Processing `ResultSet`

### CRUD Operations
- Insert, Read, Update, Delete
- Validation before update/delete
- Query-based data retrieval

### Best Practices Learned
- SQL injection prevention
- Resource management
- Exception handling
- Clean and readable database access code

---

## Database Used

- **MySQL**
- Concepts are transferable to any relational database system

---

## Learning Methodology

- Followed structured learning material
- Typed every line of code manually
- Tested queries directly in the database
- Intentionally broke code to understand errors
- Committed progress incrementally

This repository reflects **learning by building**, not copy-pasting.

---

## Project Status

🟢 **Completed**

No new features will be added here.

This repository now serves as:
- a reference point
- a proof of fundamentals
- a stable base for future backend projects

---

## What Comes Next

With JDBC fundamentals completed, I am now building **independent backend systems** where:
- JDBC knowledge is applied, not showcased
- focus shifts to **system design**, **business logic**, and **architecture**
- frameworks are used consciously, not blindly

Active development continues in newer repositories.
