# Java JDBC — Database Connectivity with Java

## Overview

This repository documents my **hands-on learning of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**.
The focus is on understanding **how Java applications interact with relational databases**, not just writing working code.

JDBC is a **core backend skill** and serves as a foundation for:
- Spring Boot
- Hibernate / JPA
- Real-world backend systems

This repository is part of my **Java → Backend → Full Stack** learning path.

---

## Why This Repository Exists

Many developers use frameworks without understanding what happens underneath.

This repository exists to:
- Learn **raw database interaction** using Java
- Understand how SQL and Java communicate
- Build confidence before moving to ORM frameworks
- Avoid treating databases as a black box

---

## Topics Covered

> This is a **progressive repository** and will grow with time.

### Core JDBC Concepts
- What JDBC is and why it exists
- JDBC architecture and drivers
- Connecting Java to a database
- `DriverManager` and `Connection`

### SQL Operations with JDBC
- `Statement` vs `PreparedStatement`
- Executing queries
- Executing updates
- Handling `ResultSet`

### CRUD Operations
- Insert data
- Read data
- Update data
- Delete data

### Best Practices
- Preventing SQL Injection
- Resource management
- Exception handling
- Clean database access patterns

---

## Database Used

- **MySQL** (primary)
- SQL concepts are transferable to other relational databases

---

## Learning Approach

- Follow a structured JDBC tutorial
- Write every line of code manually
- com.pranav.jdbc.Test queries directly in the database
- Break and fix code to understand failure cases
- Commit progress incrementally

This is **learning by building**, not note-taking.

---

## How This Fits into My Backend Journey

This repository prepares me for:
- Spring Boot REST APIs
- Hibernate / JPA
- Real backend projects with persistent data

JDBC understanding makes backend frameworks **predictable and debuggable**.

---

## Status

🟡 **In Progress**

This repository will evolve as more JDBC concepts are implemented.
